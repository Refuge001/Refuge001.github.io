# Horiseon Refactor
## Reasons for refactoring
---
1. Reduce redunant code.
2. Updated **antiquated** coding methodologies.
3. Increase the webpage's accessibility.
4. Done without altering the webpage's aesthetics *at all*.

Technologies used were updated HTML5 components and semantics and Visual Studio Code. In exploring this refactor, there were many challenges I overcame, but chief among them was ensuring the website was not altered in **any* way. It is a pixel-for-pixel copy of the previous website, but with updated semantics and increased accessibility in the form of alt img descriptions, proper use of headings, removal of unneeded div containers, and a refinement of the CSS file.
